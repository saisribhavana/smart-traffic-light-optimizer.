Emergency Vehicle Detection & Signal Time Management System
In propose work we are utilizing YOLOv8 CNN algorithm to detect various emergency vehicles such as Fire Engine, Ambulance and Police. We donâ€™t have any sensors so we are reading random values which will be consider as temperature in Fahrenheit and using below conditions to identify weather.
If temperature < 5 then weather is FOG and signal duration = 35
If temperature > 5 and < 50 then weather is Rain and signal duration = 40
Else weather is normal then signal duration = 30
With above temperature if emergency vehicle detected then signal time automatically increased to 15 more seconds.
To implement this project we have designed following modules
1)	Upload Emergency Vehicle Dataset: using this module can upload dataset to application
2)	Pre-process Dataset: this module will read all images and then extract and normalize pixel values
3)	Train Emergency Vehicle Detection Algorithm: process features will be input to algorithm to train a model and this model will be applied on test data to calculate detection accuracy
4)	Training Graph: will plot training graph
5)	Emergency Vehicle Detection from Video: using this module user can upload test videos and then system will adjust signal time based on weather data and detected emergency vehicle
